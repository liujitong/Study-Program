Tried 3 times for university. All failed.
I applied for Harvard for 10 times. All failed, they don’t even want to see me.
For the last time, I went to the teachers’ college which was considered the third or fourth class of my city.
I applied jobs for 30 times. Got rejected.
It was so difficult at that time, I was so frustrated.
Because I taught in the university. My pay was $10 a month.
Because I could not find a good job in 1994.
