These features are the transformed link-based features used in:

Carlos Castillo, Debora Donato, Aristides Gionis,
Vanessa Murdock, Fabrizio Silvestri:
"Know your Neighbors: Web Spam Detection using the Web Topology".
To appear in ACM SIGIR, 2007.
(Was DELIS technical report DELIS-TR-0458, 2006.)
http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~ccastill/papers/cdgms_2006_know_your_neighbors.pdf

Note: when computing these features, we used a few conventions
to avoid null values:

	log(x) = -50 if x<=0
	x/0    = 1   if x==0
	x/0    = 0   if x!=0

The list of homepages is here:
http://www.yr-bcn.es/webspam/datasets/uk2006-features/uk-2006-05.hostid_homepagedocid_ndocs.txt.gz

The list of pages with maximum pagerank for each host is here:
http://www.yr-bcn.es/webspam/datasets/uk2006-features/uk-2006-05.hostid_maxprdocid_pr.txt.gz

In both cases, the second field is a document-id in this list:
