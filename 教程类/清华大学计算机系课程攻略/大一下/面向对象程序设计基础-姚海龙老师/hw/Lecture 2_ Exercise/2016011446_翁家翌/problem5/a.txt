Create a class with data members distributed among
numerous public, private, and protected sections. Add a
member function showMap( ) that prints the names of
each of these data members and their addresses. If
possible, compile and run this program on more than one
compiler and/or computer and/or operating system to
see if there are layout differences in the object.

You donâ€™t need to compile and run the program using different compilers.
